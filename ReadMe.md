# networking-example

This is just a quick test I made while playing around with [SDL_Net](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net) to learn a bit more about how SDL and C++ handles networking so I can add some more functionality to [dEngine](https://github.com/DCCoder90/dengine).  Feel free to play around with it.
